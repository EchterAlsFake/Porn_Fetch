By default, Porn Fetch will select the best available video quality. You can also decide between half and worst above.
However, if you want more precise quality control, you can enter a custom integer here. For example:

2160,1440,1080,720,480,360,240,144

If the video does not support your chosen quality, it will pick the next best if available and if not the next worst.
Set the value to 0 to disable advanced quality control.

def button_help_download_mode():
    text = QCoreApplication.translate("main", """
The different threading modes are used for different scenarios. 

1) High Performance:  Uses a class of workers to download multiple video segments at a time. Can be really fast if you
have a very strong internet connection. Maybe not great for low end systems.

2) Default:  The default download mode will just download one video segment after the next one. If you get a lot of 
timeouts this can really slow down the process, as we need to wait the Porn sites to return the video segments.
With the High Performance method, we can just download other segments while waiting which makes it so fast.

def button_help_simultaneous_downloads():
    text = QCoreApplication.translate("main", f"""
The Semaphore is a tool to limit the number of simultaneous actions / downloads.

For example: If the semaphore is set to 1, only 1 video will be downloaded at the same time.
If the semaphore is set to 4, 4 videos will be downloaded at the same time. Changing this is only useful, if
you have a really good internet connection and a good system.

def button_help_network_delay():
    text = QCoreApplication.translate("main", f"""
You can set a delay between requests from you and a site. If you are downloading a lot of videos or experiencing 
errors, you should enable a delay. By default the delay is turned off with the value 0

A good starting point is between 0.5 - 1.5

The longer the delay is, the longer it will take to download videos, load videos and generally do stuff. This does not
really affect the high performance download mode.

def button_help_maximal_workers():
    text = QCoreApplication.translate("main", f"""
The maximal workers define the amount of maximal threads which can be started when using the threaded download mode.
One thread handles downloading one segment, so (in theory) 20 threads can download 20 segments at the same time.
This can of course be helpful when you have a very fast internet connection, but when you have a poor PC or running on
Android, you should set this to a lower value.

I recommend '3' for Android and 5 for low bandwidth connections < 15000 kbit/s

def button_help_timeout():

The timeout handles the timeout for retrieving segments when using the threaded download mode. If you have a poor

def button_help_speed_limit():
    text = QCoreApplication.translate("main", """
The speed limit sets the maximum allowed network speed in megabyte per seconds. However, this doesn't work perfectly.
The speed limit also only works for the default download mode, because it wouldn't make sense downloading multiple
segments at the same time with a speed limit being in place.

If you need something more 'exact / precise', use applications like NetLimiter 4 or something similar.

def button_help_processing_delay():

The processing delay sets a delay before every video gets downloaded.
Let's assume you set a delay of 30 (30 seconds), then it will take 30 seconds between each video downloads.
This does not apply if you have a value of simultaneous downloads greater than 1.

User uploads and featured videos are two different things. User uploads are the videos which were really uploaded
by the model and the featured videos are videos the model is part or featured in.

of videos from other studios.

The result limit defines how many videos will be returned when performing a search or doing other operations which

basically the number of videos which can be loaded into the tree widget (this thing where videos are displayed).

Metadata tags are saved inside of the file itself. These are tags that video players can read from and provide you information.
Some folder viewers also give you the ability to search files by specific metadata tags. Those tags can help organize and structure files.
Porn Fetch will by default save those tags inside of your video files.

The directory system will save videos in an intelligent way. If you download 3 videos form one Pornstar and 5 videos 
from another, Porn Fetch will automatically make folders for it and move the 3 videos into that one folder and the other
5 into the other. (This will still apply with your selected output path)

This can be helpful for organizing stuff, but is a more advanced feature, so the majority of users won't use it probably

If you fetch a video and the exact same filename already exists, usually Porn Fetch would just skip this file.
If you set this option to No, then Porn Fetch instead download the video and append a random number to it.

For example you have downloaded a video called:

By activating this function we bypass the tree widget. The video will be loaded into it, but immediately self-downloaded.

def button_help_anonymous_mode():

The anonymous mode renames all of Porn Fetch's elements to look NOT like a Porn downloader.

This also disables thumbnail preview. All titles will be replaced with: [redacted] as well as all authors.

If you enable this function, all errors will be suppressed. This does not mean that they will be completely ignored, but

I have created my own server that runs 24/7 in my home. Porn Fetch (ONLY if you enable it) logs specific types of errors,
that I don't know of, or that I need your help to fix them, to my server using a simple JSON post request.

You can see the Code of the server publicly here -->: https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Server
Porn Fetch also does its update checking mechanism through that server.

IMPORTANT:
The server is IPv6 only. If your ISP has not given you a working IPv6 IP address, then you can't reach me.
You can check for yourself on 'https://ipleak.net'. It should be something like this: '2a02:810a:186:b400::5c51'

My server does NOT save any of your personal information. No IP addresses, no PC information, no other identifiable information.
The only things being stored is the literal Python exception that's being caught, the version you are running on, and your system.
Like literally only if you use Windows, Linux or Mac. Nothing else.

You can see that yourself, as mentioned before on the source code.
You'd help me a lot by enabling network logging :)
