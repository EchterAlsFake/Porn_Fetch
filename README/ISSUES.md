# 1.9

9) Connection Error: This error happens because you got blocked by PornHub because you made to many requests. The only solution
                      is to wait or to change your IP address.  I sadly can not do anything about this.

10) ProxyError—Connection Error—Max Retries: Happens when PornHub closes the connection with you. (Not my fault, sorry)

# 2.1

11) ChunkedEncodingError: This error happens when you have a terrible internet. Sorry, but I can't do anything about it.
