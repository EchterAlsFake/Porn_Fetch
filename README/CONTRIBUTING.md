# Contributing to Porn Fetch

#### Every Pull Request and Issue submitted helps this project keep going.

# Setup:

If you've never used GitHub and you don't know what a "fork" is, please look on YouTube. It's really easy and useful.

1) Fork the repository
2) Clone the repository (I recommend doing it with PyCharm)
3) Make your changes and test them
4) If everything works as expected, you can submit them with a pull request.
5) (Go to the forked repo on your account page. You should see a green button there.)


# PR

* Describe the issue or the things you have done
* Implement the code with a good quality (don't need to be perfect, but you get it)
* Do not change the version number
* Please try to avoid using external libraries, but you can, if needed. (Check if they are compatible with GPL 3)
* Keep your code with some comments, that would be nice
* Use useful variable names that make sense
* Keep all your code in English
* If you got additional help from external websites with the code, please link them. That's just an act of kindness and respect

# Issues

What you can submit:

* bugs
* improvements
* weird things that you do not understand, or you don't know why they are happening
* typos
* Everything else you think it would be useful

# What I currently need:

- Someone who creates a simple Logo for Porn Fetch
