1:

Merge all attribute names of all my APIs so that they are consistent and I don't have to do ten thousand
if statements.

Make ONE function which handles receiving the attributes of a video.

-->: Give these attributes to EVERY function (where it's needed) with a Signal, so that I don't have to reload them.

- Time efficient
- Data efficient
- Simpler
- Better

2:

Reorganize the progressbars:

Instead of making progressbars for every website, why should I not just make a progressbar for every video downloaded
lmao.

(Like why didn't I get this idea the last fucking year, I mean it's soooooo much better)

-->: Give the title of the video across all functions that need it and make unique identifiers for it at runtime.
-->: Maybe even a class which handles this, so that I can just access the IDs

3:

Switch to Qts logging approach instead of using my own, because it's unprofessional, sucks and is stupidly made

-->: Make a class for debugging and error monitoring

4:
Completely redesigning the layout.

-->: I need to find out how to make the app usable on Android and Desktop

(Probably removing some functionality from the Android application to keep it maintainable, because I don't want to mess
with responsive design)

-->: Restructuring the elements and widgets (I'm probably going to take some inspiration from other applications)
