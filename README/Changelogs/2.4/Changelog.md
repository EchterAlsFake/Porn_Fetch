# 2.4
- If you use the file / model - user - channel functionality, then the TreeWidget will be used
  to let you select the videos that you want to download instead of downloading everything
- fixed an issue in the termux build script
- API updated to v3.1-4
- You can now select if you want to have a delay or not (enabling it is recommended!)
- OS error is fixed (FOR REAL!)
- Sentry strips out sensitive information and now only the exception, lines of code, server name is reported
  (Although I need to still test that.)

The next update will focus more on features / compatibility to other systems.
I hope that most issues are now fixed.
