# 1.1
- Code refactoring
- Added Support for downloading a whole channel / user
- Fixed an Issue with the progress bar
- Fixed typo issues
- Fixed the output path issue
- Changed License to LGPLv3 (The reason for this is, that I am stupid and I used the wrong license. Creative Commons is not valid to be used for developing with Qt. I didn't know that, I am sorry...)
