# 1.0
Initial Release

# 1.1
- Code refactoring
- Added Support for downloading a whole channel / user
- Fixed an Issue with the progress bar
- Fixed typo issues
- Fixed the output path issue
- Changed License to LGPLv3 (The reason for this is, that I am stupid and I used the wrong license. Creative Commons is not valid to be used for developing with Qt. I didn't know that, I am sorry...)
# 1.2
- Added additional stuff to the metadata function (Likes, Image URL, Tags)
- Added border colours for input fields

# 1.3
- Added Threading Modes
- Single: Downloads will be executed within the main thread, and the GUI won't respond to your actions if the download isn't finished.

- Multiple: Download(s) will be executed with separate Threads (QThreads). This is mostly intended for single downloads. You can use that function also for multiple downloads, but that will ruin the progress bar, because it will jump between the different videos.
