Although my code should not be used in a Public environment, if you find a Security Vulnerability, then please submit it
via E-Mail: EchterAlsFake@proton.me or via Discord: echteralsfake (Old Tag System: EchterAlsFake#7164)

Do NOT report outdated libraries. The compiled versions of my program, ALWAYS use the newest libraries, dependencies and Python Version.

Just in Case you want to use it as a Web App for other Users or something else:

Strip symbols out from the title. The Title can have a / at the end and someone could upload a video on PornHub
with for an example ../../../../../etc/passwd as title in it. This is called a Path Traversal attack.

The chance that this is happening is nearly 0%, but keep it in mind. 
For Private use, this doesn't matter.
