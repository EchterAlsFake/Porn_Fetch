(Sorry, but today some unexpected things happened, and I am not able to fix the search filters right now.
I try it, but I don't think it's going to work out now, so I hope I can get them working tomorrow, but 
tomorrow is also a really stressful day, but on Sunday I have time... At least it's worth waiting.
That's what I can say.)
