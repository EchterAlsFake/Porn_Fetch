# Android:

2023 - 24. December 

I have some interesting news to share. I tried compiling PySide6 to Android the last 3 hours, and I am as close as I've
never been. I am literally at the process, where Gradle is trying to build the java project. (Buildozer)

I will try to do further in the next days. But even if I get PySide6 running, I have no idea how tf I am supposed to
get the PHUB library and all the other stuff running. I would need to make a custom receipt and do a lot of stuff.

Kivy was hard, but this is hell :)

But every day I get a step closer, and you know what... If I get that done, I'd be the first who compiles PySide6 :) 



- [] PySide6 to Android (will probably fail ;) 
- [] Download from file
- [] Download from Model
- [] Search Query support
- [] Persistent settings
- [] Title stripping
- [] Debugging / Logging
