# Android:

Okay, So I got the frontend for my Application working. I also got external libraries working. Unfortunately,
the official pyside6-android-deploy script is a bit buggy, so I needed to modify it in order to work for it.
<br>The problem is now, that the Android build uses Python 3.10. I'll try to get it for Python 3.11, but I'll
<br>try to make it work with Python 3.10. I need to wait for Egsagon to update the PHUB Library with the py-3.9
<br>Branch, and then I can start working on it.



- [x] PySide6 to Android (will probably fail ;) (Nah it didn't :) 
- [] Download from file
- [] Download from Model
- [] Search Query support
- [] Persistent settings
- [] Title stripping
- [] Debugging / Logging
