"""
The goal is to build a dynamic layout which supports landscape and portrait mode.
The problem is, that I am not good at designing resizeable layout as I've never 
done it.

But I want to at least try it, although it means a lot of work.
But when all this sh*t is done, I've finally built an application which is a stable
real-world showcase project. This would also be a template for my other projects, so that 
every UI / Application that I build is designed like Porn Fetch.

You know all people in my environment are kinda laughing me out for this project, but the
difference between them and me is, that I build a project people are using, and they are just 
scrolling through TikTok :skull:

# Maybe or maybe not:
- [] Enabling optional downloading over the tor network or proxies
- [] Distributing Porn Fetch over the p2p network too
- [] Supporting FFmpeg on Android
