Where I was:

My Account got banned due to a suspicious login attempt. I couldn't develop for
two weeks, and I am currently trying to get away from caffeine for some time which 
completely destroyed my sleep rhythm. 

I will now slowly start fixing the project, but it will still take time and my biggest
problem is the layout. I don't know so much about it and getting Android and Desktop
under a roof isn't easy for me. 


But there's also a good thing. I got an iPhone 6S (I still hate iOS) but this means
that I can now fix this stupid build script lol.

(Like imagine Apple still doesn't support LDAC... And they call themselves "innovative")
