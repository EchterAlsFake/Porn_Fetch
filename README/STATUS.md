Update:

Since the UI is a lot optimized for desktop systems I decided to make just a new UI file for Android devices, or to say
for smartphones. I will then use the same buttons, same connections, and same functions, but the design will be different.
This means that I don't have to rewrite this entire thing :)


In 2 weeks I have summer holidays (21th June) and then we can bring some ðŸ”¥ into this project :)
