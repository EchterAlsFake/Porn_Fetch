# FAQ:


## Q: Is using Porn Fetch legal?

No, Porn Fetch is against the "Terms of Services" (ToS) of the websites it supports downloading from. It's not against the law,
but against the ToS and the website owners may decide to take legal actions against users or maybe even against this project.
We are in a very "grey" area here. Porn Fetch was made to download videos for offline usage, NOT for stealing copyright protected content
in a mass. Please do not use Porn Fetch to massively scrape websites in order to redistribute videos.

I can't prevent you from doing this, but if you want this project to keep alive, please use it fairly.

## Q: Do I need to log in into my PornHub account? 

No, you can. Logging in into your PornHub account allows you to fetch videos based on your account history, but it's not
mandatory. Just a feature.


(I'll add more here later...)
