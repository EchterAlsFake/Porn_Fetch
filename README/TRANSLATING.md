# How to port Porn Fetch into my language?

First of all, thanks for doing this. I appreciate every string you translate!

The easiest way is using Qt Linguist. Please search Online for Installing it. It's easy ;) 


# Setup

> Forking the Repository is HIGHLY recommended. If you know how to do Pull Requests, do it!

1) Clone the Repository: $ git clone https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch  (or fork it and use your fork for later PR)
2) Install Qt Linguist. Search Online how to do that. It's really easy.

# Translating

3) Open Qt Linguist, click "File", click "Open" and open the en.ts file in Porn_Fetch/src/translations/
4) In the dialog set English as Language and United States as Country / Region. Set your Target Language and Country / Region
5) Now click on each of the 110 (or more) strings and enter your translation in the little box below
6) When you are done with a translation, click the green checkmark in the left area of the strings
7) When you've translated everything you can save (CTRL + S).

And that's it. You don't have to do the converting process into .qm or embedding into the ressource file.
<br>I'll do that by myself. You can send the .ts file with a Pull Request or open an Issue or send them via E-Mail:

EchterAlsFake@proton.me


If you are unsure about a translation leave it out. It's not a problem.
<br>It's your decision if you want to use formal language or not. I don't care about that.


# Video Tutorial:

I created a video that demonstrates the process.
