UI = Finished
UX: Finished


Alright, all widgets are now inside of the QMainWindow's stacked widget. The next goal is, to outsource all classes
into external python files to clean up the code. This works by giving the self.ui into the other classes via the __init__
method. However, I need to check if I can also connect Signals and Slots with it, but should be good.
I'll probably need to outsource the Signals class too and then just import that class into other files and work with that.
