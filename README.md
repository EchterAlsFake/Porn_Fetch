If you want to use Porn Fetch now, please ONLY use it from the source code but NOT from the releases.


Thank you all, I'll let you know when it's fixed. For updates, please refer to the issue mentioned above. Thanks.

### You can see more information [HERE](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/blob/master/README/WEBSITES.md)


## Working with Files
Porn Fetch allows you to use a URL or kind of batch file to programmatically download all videos, models, and search
terms listed in there.

Here's a short documentation on how to use it:

> [!NOTE]
> The format ending of the file doesn't matter.

Here's a quick example on how to use it. It should explain anything by itself:

```text
Inside the File:

url # The url of some video you want to download. Just in raw format, like when you would download it.
model#pornhub.com/pornstar/whatever # First enter "model#" after the # follows the model URL
search#query#website  # First enter search# then the query and then after another hashtag the website you want to search on.


Porn Fetch supports all URLs, Models and search terms like it would if you use the basic GUI for downloading.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the search function, make sure the website is the exact same name like in the URL between www. and .com
> e., for "https://www.pornhub.com" it would be just "pornhub" or for "https://xvideos.com" it would be just "xvideos"


If you still need a real example file, [here you go](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/blob/eac6fa2ccf644e4b30816a7bd2fa0257b2a03e36/src/backend/urls.txt)

## üî® Building from Source
Easy-to-use build scripts are available for various platforms. Run these in your terminal:

### For Ubuntu, Windows, Arch Linux, Termux, Fedora, OpenSUSE:
```bash
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install.sh" -O install.sh
bash install.sh
```
### For Termux:
```bash
wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install_termux.sh" | bash
```
### For Windows (Powershell as Admin)
```
# Enable script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned 
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install_windows.ps1 -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

> Scripts aren't maintained very often. Please report errors immediately!

## üì± Android
The Android app is the exact same as the desktop app. Thanks to Qt's Android developing Guide, you'll be able to simply
install the .apk file, and you have the full version of Porn Fetch on your device.

### Building for Android
Building the PySide6 application by yourself isn't possible through a simple script. If you really want
to do it, please refer to my [Pyside6-to-Android](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/PySide6-to-Android) repository.
