# Porn Fetch

#### We all know that feeling when we try to download something from Pornhub and then we go to our Search Engine and what we find is shady websites, with too much ads and payment concepts in it. I decided to fuck this shit and now I created it by myself.

# API

### I am using the [PHUB](https://github.com/Egsagon/PHUB) API from Egsagon. This Project would not be possible without this AWESOME API

## Is this legal? 

I don't know about the law in your country. I can only say in Germany it's allowed to download 7 copyright licensed materials.
Also, you need to be at least 18+ years old to watch (and have) Porn videos. I am not liable for anything! You know what you do

# GUI

The Graphical User Interface was created with PySide6 (Qt for Python)
# Releases

Some releases are too big for GitHub. In that case, you can find it on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sGvhAO_qQB87AOfyVDWPJZluVettBwaj?usp=sharing)

# Other Infos

- ### If Progressbar get's stuck, this is normal. Just wait.
- ### Output path must contain a slash at the end

# Building from Source

- Download a Version of Python 3.X along with pip (I did all this with Python 3.11.4)
- Clone the project with git or using the zipfile
- Install needed pip packages: pip (or pip3) install pyside6 phub wget colorama pyinstaller
- git clone https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch
- cd Porn_Fetch
- pyinstaller -F widget.py
- In you dist directory, there is the executable file

## 1.1

- Code refactoring
- Added Support for downloading a whole channel / user
- Fixed an Issue with the progress bar
- Fixed typo issues
- Fixed the output path issue
