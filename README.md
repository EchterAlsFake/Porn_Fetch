# Supported Platforms

* Windows : Native Support for Windows 10 / 11 for X64 / X86 Systems
* Linux   : Native Support on all X11 / Wayland systems with Qt Support. Just run the AppImage
* macOS   : Needs to either be built from source, or run it natively with Python3 from source code
* Android : Can be run with either VNC for the GUI or within a terminal emulator with Python
* iOS     : Same as Android.  You can install iSH from the App Store and install Python3 on it. 
* ARM devices: For all arm devices, the compiled versions won't work. You need to either run it natively or compile it by yourself.

# Building from Source

Note, this is for advanced users and is NOT needed for the average guy out there...

Make sure you are using a Linux Environment and have the following dependencies installed: git python3 python3-pip
<br>Ubuntu Users also need to have:  python3-venv   installed.


This Process does NOT require root access!
```
mkdir build output && cd build && git clone https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch && cd Porn_Fetch && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && pyinstaller -F widget.py && cd dist && mv widget Porn_Fetch && chmod +x Porn_Fetch && mv Porn_Fetch ../../../output/ && echo "Porn Fetch is now in the output directory!"

# Common Issues

* Unhandled Error: Index out of range
   <br> This is an error caused by the API. Restarting the application usually fixes this.
   <br>
* Nothing happens, when I click a button
 <br> I am aware of that. Restarting the Application will fix the error for now, but I am trying to implement a "refresh" feature which would resolve this.

# Legal Rights

I don't know about the Law in the U.S.
<br>I am not a Lawyer and I can not say much to it. Probably nothing happens, when you use this program, but if you really want to be safe, then use a VPN.
<br>For me in Germany, you need to be at least 18 years old to watch & have porn. (I know I am not 18, but let's put that away ^^)
<br>Also, You are downloading copyright protected content, so it's a risky thing. It's like when you download music from YouTube.  It's a gray zone.
<br>But in the end, I am not liable for it. Don't ask me if you got in trouble.

# Credits

####  A BIG thanks to [Egasgon](https://github.com/Egsagon), who created the [PHUB](https://github.com/Egsagon/PHUB) API, which is the API I am using. Without his project, I would not be able to make this program.
####  Thanks to ChatGPT for helping me with the Threading, Signal and Slots stuff.
####  Thanks to the Qt Company for giving people like me the opportunity to use some really nice developing Tools like Qt Creator / Designer for free Open-Source developing.
####  <br>I really appreciate that!

#### And of course the external libraries, that I used within my code:
* [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
* [sentry sdk](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python) Used in 1.7+ 


# License:

So and here we have a "little" problem. I started this project, when I was 14 years old.
I licensed it under Creative Commons, but this is of course NOT the right license to be used for Open-Source Software development.
I did some research and I realized that I need to use either LGPL or GPL license for an Open-Source development with Qt for Python.
I decided to use the LGPLv3 License. I don't know why, because it was a big mistake. The LGPLv3 License is used by libraries and not
by a full standalone Application. So I need to change my License to GPL. I talked to ChatGPT about it, because I don't have
money for a Lawyer and I guess ChatGPT is a bit smarter than some users on reddit. We figured out, that the external libraries that I am using
within my Project are compatible with the GPL License. 

I am using the following external libraries:

* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
* [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)
* [sentry_sdk](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python)
* [phub](https://github.com/Egsagon/PHUB/blob/master/LICENSE)

tqdm uses the  MPL (Mozilla Public License) 2.0 and the MIT License <br>
colorama uses the BSD 3 license <br>
sentry sdk uses the MIT License <br>
phub uses the GPL license<br>

I can just say: Sorry. <br>
We all were young and dumb, but I don't delete my mistakes. I stay behind them, and I want to be transparent to everyone.
