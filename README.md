### You can find more information [HERE](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/blob/master/README/WEBSITES.md)


## Batch processing
Porn Fetch allows you to use batch / automatic processing of videos, models and search queries

Here's a short documentation on how to use it:

> [!NOTE]
> The format ending of the file doesn't matter.

Here's a quick example on how to use it. It should explain anything by itself:

```text
Inside the File:

url # The url of some video you want to download. Just in raw format, like when you would download it.
model#pornhub.com/pornstar/whatever # First enter "model#" after the # follows the model URL
search#query#website  # First enter search# then the query and then after another hashtag the website you want to search on.


Porn Fetch supports all URLs, Models and search terms like it would if you use the basic GUI for downloading.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the search function, make sure the website is the exact same name like in the URL between www. and .com
> e., for "https://www.pornhub.com" it would be just "pornhub" or for "https://xvideos.com" it would be just "xvideos"

If you still need a real example file, [here you go](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/blob/eac6fa2ccf644e4b30816a7bd2fa0257b2a03e36/src/backend/urls.txt)

## üî® Building from Source
Easy-to-use build scripts are available for various platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> Building will be done using Python3.12 and [Nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka) using Qt's `pyside6-deploy` tool.

Hardware requirements:
- ~1.5 GB of hard disk space
- ~2‚Äì3 GB of RAM
- A processor that can do some math

> Compilation takes around 5‚Äì20 minutes depending on your system and hardware.

### Linux (Ubuntu, Arch-based, Debian-based, OpenSUSE)
> [!NOTE]
> There is no official list of tested Linux distributions. I develop Porn Fetch only on Arch Linux. If you come across
> an issue, you can always report it and I will distro-hop to solve it.

```bash
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install.sh" -O install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Termux
```bash
apt install wget -y && wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install_termux.sh" | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell as Admin)
```
# Enable script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned 
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install_windows.ps1 -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

### macOS
> [!NOTE]
> You need to have the Apple Developer command line tools installed. You can install them by going into your terminal
> and run `xcode-select --install`


```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install_macos.sh" -o install.sh
bash install.sh
```

> [!CAUTION]
> macOS support is experimental and not tested on real certified Apple Hardware...

### Android
> [!NOTE]
> Building for Android is currently being tested, please do not do it yet!

**Make sure your host system has the following dependencies installed**
- jdk17-openjdk
- llvm
- openssl
- python3.11

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/build_android.sh" -o build_android.sh
bash build_android.sh
```


**Please Read:**
<br>The created file will be a `.app` file. You cannot usually run it as you would, because it doesn't work for some reason...
Instead you need to go inside the `.app` package using a Terminal and run the main file in it.

You can do that with something like `./<the_app_package.app/Contents/MacOS/main`

At the moment, this is unfortunately the only way how I can support macOS. I will try to make this easier in the future, but it 
doesn't depend on me.

## üì± Android
The Android app is the exact same as the desktop app. Thanks to Qt's Android developing Guide, you'll be able to simply
install the .apk file, and you have the full version of Porn Fetch on your device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Android is currently broken, use Termux instead!

# Sponsoring / Donations
Porn Fetch is developed entirely Open-Source and will always be free, because I like what
I am doing here. I will never ever charge money for this software.

However, I kindly ask every one of you to donate a small amount of money. If you have Monero (crypto)
or PayPal, you can donate me here:

- Paypal: `https://paypal.me/EchterAlsFake`

Even if it's just 10 cents, for me, it matters, because I do not work yet and it means a lot
to me :)
